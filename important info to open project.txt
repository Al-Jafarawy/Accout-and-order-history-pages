### Steps to Run the Project:

1. **Extract the ZIP file** (if not already done).
2. **Open Visual Studio Code**.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the extracted files (the folder should be named `account-app`).
4. Open the terminal inside VS Code, ensuring the terminalâ€™s path ends with `account-app`.
5. Install the required dependencies by running the `npm install` command.
6. After installation, start the application by running the `npm run start` command. The app will open in your default browser.

### Running the Mock API (json-server):

1. **Ensure Node.js is installed**. If not, download it from the official Node.js website.
2. Run the mock API by executing the appropriate command to start `json-server` and watch the `db.json` file on port 5000.
3. If you get an error that the command is not recognized, install `json-server` globally and then run the command again.
4. Make sure the `db.json` file is inside the project folder, or specify its correct path.

### Testing:

1. After setting everything up, run the tests using the `npm test` command.
2. The tests should pass successfully if the setup is correct.
3. If the user fails to fetch data, the app will display five dummy products and show an error message saying "Failed to fetch data."
